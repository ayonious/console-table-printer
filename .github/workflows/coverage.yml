# Code Coverage Workflow
#
# This workflow generates and uploads code coverage reports to Codecov. It performs:
# - Runs all tests with coverage reporting enabled
# - Generates coverage reports in various formats
# - Uploads coverage data to Codecov for tracking and visualization
# - Provides coverage badges and trend analysis
#
# This helps maintain high code quality by ensuring adequate test coverage
# and provides visibility into which parts of the codebase are well-tested.
#
# Triggers: Push to master, pull requests to master
# Requires: CODECOV_TOKEN secret for uploading to Codecov
