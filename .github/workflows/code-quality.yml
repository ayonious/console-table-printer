# Code Quality Workflow
#
# This workflow ensures code quality standards are maintained by running:
# - ESLint linting to check for code style and potential issues
# - Prettier formatting checks to ensure consistent code formatting
#
# These checks help maintain code quality and consistency across the project.
#
# Triggers: Push to master, pull requests (opened, synchronize, reopened)
